# React Portfolio

This is my first web development portfolio using react. As I gain more knowledge and experience I expect to come back to this portfolio and add projects, change layouts and share a deeper understanding of the react platform. For now however, this was a great lessson to learning how use state and use effect works. 

## User Story 

AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
